EPISODE 1 – “Ashes of Poland”

Opening Scene – The Outskirts of Kraków

Several months after the collapse.

The world hasn’t frozen — instead, it’s eerily warm for winter, storms rolling in instead of snow.

The undead still move freely through empty fields and broken towns.

In the outskirts of Kraków, a small group of survivors shelters in a school gym.

Rumors say there’s still military evacuation happening through Czechia.


Main Characters:

Elena (player) – Polish paramedic, the heart of the group; stubbornly hopeful.

Markus – Czech mechanic, knowledgeable about rail routes.

Nadia – Belarusian teenager, quick, suspicious, fiercely loyal to Elena.

Tobias – German teacher, old and weary, trying to keep their humanity intact.

Act 1 – Leaving Poland

The group sets out on foot, following damaged highways toward the Czech border.

Days are long and humid, the air thick with decay — the dead move easily.

They scavenge abandoned cars, see entire families frozen in fear, not cold.

A radio tower crackles faintly — a voice in English begging for help “south of Brno.”



---

Act 2 – The Road and the Ruins

They pass through rural villages where people tried to hold out, failing miserably.

They learn through notes and messages that power plants have gone offline, and the infection spread faster as people migrated west.

They find an old truck full of corpses, the driver’s note reading: “They said to head west. The cold never came.”

The group keeps moving, driven by hope and guilt.



---

Act 3 – The Border Crossing

The border is chaos — abandoned vehicles, blood on the bridges, decomposing bodies.

A single checkpoint stands silent; inside, the last guards wrote their final orders on the walls: “Do not let them cross. Do not follow.”

Tobias is bitten trying to protect Nadia from a small group of undead.

They burn the checkpoint and keep walking, crossing into Czechia under an orange, dusty sunset.

End Scene: Elena turns on their radio again — only static, then faint Russian words: “…east… colder there… safer…”

She doesn’t understand the meaning yet.

EPISODE 2 – “The Silent Border”

Opening Scene – Entering Czechia

The land looks the same: forests, towns, dead roads — but quieter.

Fewer undead at first, but the group assumes it’s luck.

The weather stays warm; the air heavy, full of ash.

Markus insists they keep heading south; Elena questions whether there’s anyone left to find.



---

Act 1 – The Village of Brno

They reach the outskirts of Brno, where the evacuation broadcasts originated.

It’s deserted. The refugee camps are burned, the streets lined with bodies.

They find written logs in English, Czech, and Russian — the same phrase appears repeatedly:
“Head north. Cold stops them. Don’t stay warm.”

The group doesn’t believe it yet. It sounds insane — but the undead they see here are slower, some barely moving.



---

Act 2 – The Factory

Searching for supplies, they find a maintenance depot connected to old railway lines.

Inside, bodies of engineers and soldiers are frozen mid-action — like they just stopped moving.

The air is much cooler here; it’s underground and insulated.

One corpse suddenly reanimates when a generator sparks and warms the room — the others remain still.

The truth starts to form: heat reawakens them.

Markus insists it’s coincidence, but Nadia is terrified — “the warmth keeps them alive.”



---

Act 3 – The Trainyard

They follow the railway tracks outside the factory and find it:
a full, intact train, half-buried under leaves and dust, not snow — a relic of the last evacuation.

The locomotive is huge, armored, and well-preserved.

Inside, they find tools, ration packs, and maintenance manuals in Russian and Czech — signs that this train was heading east before being abandoned.

Markus checks the engine and realizes it’s in surprisingly good shape — just clogged lines, old fuel, and a few mechanical fixes needed.



---

Final Sequence

The group works together to restore the train as a storm builds overhead.

Elena starts to connect everything: the notes, the voices on the radio, the soldiers’ messages — they all pointed north, toward colder regions.

As Markus clears the final valve, the train coughs, sputters, and then roars to life, echoing across the empty hills.

A flock of birds takes off — the loudest sound in weeks.

The group looks at each other, shocked, hopeful, terrified.

The wind carries faint snowflakes — the first hint of the cold they now understand might be salvation.


End Scene:

The camera pulls back as the train’s headlights cut through the dusk.

The engine hums steadily, ready to move.
